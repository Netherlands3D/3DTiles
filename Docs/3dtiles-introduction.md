# 3D Tiles Introduction: Explicit & Implicit Tiling, Quadtrees, and Morton Index

This page provides a conceptual overview of the 3D Tiles format, including explicit and implicit tiling, quadtree structures, and the Morton (Z-order) index for spatial subdivision.

## What is 3D Tiles?
3D Tiles is an open specification for streaming and rendering massive heterogeneous 3D geospatial datasets. It is used for city models, photogrammetry, point clouds, and more. Tiles are organized in a spatial hierarchy, allowing efficient loading and rendering based on view and level of detail (LOD).

# Explicit Tiling
In explicit tiling, every tile and its children are explicitly listed in the tileset JSON. Each tile contains a list of its children, their bounding volumes, geometric errors, and content URIs. This approach is straightforward and flexible, but can result in very large tileset files for deep or wide hierarchies.

**Example (explicit):**
```json
{
  "root": {
    "boundingVolume": { "region": [...] },
    "geometricError": 500,
    "refine": "REPLACE",
    "children": [
      {
        "boundingVolume": { "region": [...] },
        "geometricError": 250,
        "content": { "uri": "tile1.glb" },
        "children": [ ... ]
      },
      ...
    ]
  }
}
```

# Implicit Tiling
Implicit tiling is a technique in 3D Tiles that allows you to define a regular, deeply nested tile structure (like a quadtree or octree) without explicitly listing every tile in the tileset JSON. Instead, a set of rules and templates define how tiles are subdivided and addressed.

- **Root tile**: Covers the entire region of interest (e.g., the world or a city).
- **Subdivision**: Each tile is subdivided into 4 (quadtree, 2D) or 8 (octree, 3D) child tiles.
- **Levels**: Each subdivision increases the level (LOD) by 1, halving the tile size in each dimension.
- **BoundingVolume**: Each tile has a bounding volume (region, box, or sphere) that defines its spatial extent.

**Example (implicit):**
```json
{
  "root": {
    "boundingVolume": { "region": [minLon, minLat, maxLon, maxLat, minHeight, maxHeight] },
    "geometricError": 500,
    "refine": "REPLACE",
    "implicitTiling": {
      "subdivisionScheme": "QUADTREE",
      "availableLevels": 14,
      "subtreeLevels": 3,
      "subtrees": { "uri": "subtrees/{level}/{x}/{y}.subtree" }
    },
    "content": { "uri": "content/{level}/{x}/{y}.glb" }
  }
}
```

# Explicit vs. Implicit Tiling
| Feature                | Explicit Tiling                        | Implicit Tiling                         |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Tile listing           | All tiles listed in JSON               | Tiles generated by rules/templates       |
| File size              | Can be very large for big hierarchies  | Compact, even for deep trees            |
| Flexibility            | Arbitrary hierarchies possible         | Regular (quadtree/octree) only          |
| Addressing             | By tree traversal                      | By (level, x, y) or Morton index        |
| Use case               | Small/medium, irregular datasets       | Large, regular, grid-like datasets      |

In summary: **Explicit tiling** is best for small or irregular datasets where you need full control over the hierarchy. **Implicit tiling** is ideal for massive, regular datasets (like terrain, photogrammetry, or city meshes) where a grid structure is sufficient and scalability is critical.

# Quadtree Structure
A quadtree recursively subdivides a 2D area into four quadrants:

```
Level 0: [root]
Level 1: [0,0], [0,1], [1,0], [1,1]
Level 2: [0,0], [0,1], [1,0], [1,1] for each parent, etc.
```

- At each level, the number of tiles = 4^level.
- Each tile can be uniquely identified by its (level, x, y) coordinates.

# Morton Index (Z-order Curve)
The Morton index (or Z-order curve) is a way to map 2D (or 3D) tile coordinates to a single integer, preserving spatial locality. It is often used for efficient tile addressing and storage.

- **Interleaving bits**: For (x, y), the Morton code is created by interleaving the bits of x and y.
- **Example**: x=2 (10b), y=3 (11b) → Morton code = 1101b = 13

This allows fast lookup and traversal of tiles in memory or on disk.

## Abbreviations & terms

- SSE — Screen Space Error. A metric used to decide whether a tile's geometric error is acceptable given its projected size on screen. Lower SSE means higher perceived detail; SSE is typically compared to a threshold to determine whether to refine (load children) or use the parent tile.
- LOD — Level of Detail. Refers to the depth/level in the tile hierarchy; higher LODs are more detailed (smaller tiles).
- GLB — Binary GLTF. A single-file binary GLTF asset that contains geometry, textures and materials; commonly used as content payloads for 3D Tiles.
- ECEF — Earth-Centered, Earth-Fixed. A Cartesian coordinate system centered at the Earth's center; often used for global geospatial positioning.
- SSE component / sseComponent — A camera- and screen-dependent scalar used when calculating screen-space error (often derived from screen height and camera FOV). Multiplying geometricError by this component produces a screen-space scaled error.
- REPLACE / ADD — Refinement modes for tiles: REPLACE means a parent tile replaces its children when rendered; ADD means parent and children are rendered together (additive refinement).
