## Current Location

The latest version and future updates of this package will be maintained inside the Netherlands3D main repository as part of an effort to simplify and unify our development workflow.

## Why was this repository archived?

To streamline development and reduce overhead, the Netherlands3D packages are being integrated into the main repository.  
This approach allows for better coordination between packages and features, while we continue to evaluate whether a full monorepo setup (including versioning) is desirable in the future.
